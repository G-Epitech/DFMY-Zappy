# AI Project "Hamster Family"

## Context

The "Hamster Family" AI project is part of the Zappy project developed at Epitech. Zappy is a game divided into three parts: a server, a graphical interface, and artificial intelligences (AI). Each part contributes to creating an interactive gaming environment where AIs must cooperate and compete to survive and thrive.

## AI Objective

The "Hamster Family" AI draws its name from the oddly sinister inspiration of hamsters. In nature, hamsters have a strangely paradoxical reputation: while cute and cuddly, they also have a tendency to cannibalize, especially when food is scarce.

The objective of "Hamster Family" is to survive and thrive in a world where resources, especially food, are limited. To achieve this, the AI exploits an unusual but effective strategy: generating other AIs for their own survival.

## AI Operation

When "Hamster Family" detects a critical need for food, it generates a new AI. This new entity is programmed to give all its food to the main AI. This process, though shocking in concept, allows "Hamster Family" to prolong its own survival by exploiting the resources of the newly generated AIs.

Furthermore, "Hamster Family" is aware of the need to level up to thrive further. Thus, it coordinates its actions with other AIs to collect precious stones scattered on the map. Once these stones are collected, the AIs must gather on the same tile to perform an "elevation" and level up.

## Conclusion

"Hamster Family" represents a unique and creative approach to overcoming the challenges of the Zappy game. By embracing the idea of hamster cannibalism as a source of inspiration, this AI demonstrates the ability of artificial intelligence to use unconventional strategies to achieve its goals in complex and constrained environments.
